# Slide Title

Here's some information on a slide.

*   Feel free
*   to also
*   use lists
*   if you'd like<img src="/Users/YanzhiWang/Desktop/Screen Shot 2019-09-05 at 8.45.34 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-05 at 8.45.34 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />


<div class="notes">
You also have some extra things that you'd like to talk about while this slide is on the board.
It'd be a good idea to keep track of those, then, print them out, and take them with you to class.
</div>

# Another Slide

1.  Numbered lists
2.  of course
3.  will also work

<div class="notes">
*   You can use the full array of Markdown formatting
*   inside _your notes_
*   **without any problem**
</div>

<div class="notes">
This joke requires explaining.
</div>

# A Final Slide

> I also included a slightly fancier than usual block-quote format, if you're into that kind of thing.

<div class="notes">
That would definitely be something you'd want to elaborate on.
</div>
